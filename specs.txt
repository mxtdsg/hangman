The Hangman Game
================

Hangman is a word guessing game[1]. Your task is to write a *simple* Hangman
game as a Web application.

For your review, the rules for Hangman are as follows:

- When the game is started, the player is represented with an empty field for
  each letter in the word.

- When the player guesses a letter correctly, each field that represents that
  letter is filled with the letter.

- When the player guesses a letter incorrectly, a piece of a gallow with a
  hanging man is drawn.

- After 10 incorrect guesses, the game is over and the player lost. Thus,
  there should be 10 different states of the gallow to be drawn.

- If all fields are filled with their letter before 10 incorrect guesses, the
  player has won the game.

The technical requirements are as follows:

- Server/client based with the client being the browser

- Business logic executed on the server (so nobody can cheat)

- Allow for keeping simple statistics (games won/lost)

- Game is self-contained

- Game must scale to millions of users (discussion)

While this project does not need to be your masterpiece, you should develop
the game to the best of your abilities. Afterall, the goal is to get a sense
of your software development abilities.

There is no theoretical due date. Please try to submit the game in a
reasonable timeframe though.

I would like you to write the game in the technology of your choice. The
interview will consist of explaining your work and discussing possible
extensions to it.

Once you are done please send me the code including instructions on how to
install and run the application on Linux.
